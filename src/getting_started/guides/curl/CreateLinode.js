        <h1>Creating a Linode</h1>

          Creating a Linode requires you to be logged in. Before proceeding, make sure you have
          gone through the&nbsp;
          <Link to={`${API_VERSION}/guides/curl/testing-with-curl`}>
            testing with curl guide
          </Link>,
          since you will need an authorization token to proceed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before you can create a Linode, you will need to choose a <strong>region</strong>,
          a <strong>type</strong>, and a <strong>distribution</strong>.
          The API has endpoints available to help you do this.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Selecting a region</h2>
        <p>
          A <Link to={`/${API_VERSION}/reference/endpoints/regions`}>region</Link> is a physical
          location that contains Linodes. To retrieve a list of available region, you can use the
          /regions API endpoint. To make an API call against this endpoint over curl, run the
          following command:
        </p>
        <Code example={`curl ${API_ROOT}/${API_VERSION}/regions`} name="bash" />
        <p>
          Note that since the region list is public information, you don’t need to send your
          authorization token (although it will still work if you do). The above command will
          return a JSON object like the following:
        </p>
        <Code
          example={`{
  "data": [
      {
          "id": "us-east-1a",
          "label": "Newark, NJ",
          "country": "US"
      }
      /* and so on */
  ],
  "page": 1,
  "pages": 1,
  "results": 7
}`}
          name="json"
          noclipboard
        />
        <p>
          The region list is pretty self-explanatory: regions' geographical locations are
          provided in the <code>label</code> field. The <code>id</code> field is a unique ID
          which you’ll use to refer to the region you want to select. For this example,
          we’ll go with the "Newark, NJ" region with ID "us-east-1a".
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Selecting a type</h2>
        <p>
          Once you have a region in mind, the next step is to choose a Linode type. A type
          determines the resources available to your new Linode (such as memory, storage space,
          and network transfer). Run the following curl command to retrieve a list of available
          Linode plans:
        </p>
        <Code example={`curl ${API_ROOT}/${API_VERSION}/linode/types`} name="bash" />
        <p>
          The above command will return a JSON object like the following:
        </p>
        <Code
          example={`{
  "data": [
      {
          "id": "g5-standard-1",
          "label": "Linode 2048",
          "vcpus": 1,
          "network_out": 125,
          "disk": 24576,
          "price_hourly": 1,
          "class": "standard",
          "memory": 2048,
          "price_monthly": 1000,
          "backups_option": {
            "price_hourly": 0.004,
            "price_monthly": 2.5
          },
          "transfer": 2000
      }
      /* and so on */
  ],
  "page": 1,
  "pages": 1,
  "results": 1
}`}
          name="json"
          noclipboard
        />
        <p>
          Each entry in the types list represents an available Linode type. You can review
          the details of each plan, such as the number of virtual CPUs, memory, disk space,
          monthly price, etc. For explanations of each field, see the&nbsp;
          <Link to={`/${API_VERSION}/reference/endpoints/linode/types`}>
            complete type reference
          </Link>
          . Once you have selected the type you want to launch, note its ID and continue to
          the next step.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Selecting a distribution</h2>
        <p>
          Now you need to choose a Linux distribution to deploy to your new Linode.
          Just like selecting a type and a region, issue a call to the API, this time
          for a list of available distributions:
        </p>
        <Code example={`curl ${API_ROOT}/${API_VERSION}/linode/distributions`} name="bash" />
        <p>
          This will provide you with a list of distributions like the following:
        </p>
        <Code
          example={`{
  "data": [
      {
          "id": "linode/debian8",
          "label": "Debian 8",
          "vendor": "Debian",
          "architecture": "x86_64",
          "recommended": true,
          "disk_minimum": 900,
          "updated": "2015-04-27T16:26:41"
      }
      /* and so on */
  ],
  "page": 1,
  "pages": 1,
  "results": 1
}`}
          name="json"
          noclipboard
        />
        <p>
          For detailed information about each field, see the complete&nbsp;
          <Link to={`/${API_VERSION}/reference/endpoints/linode/distributions`}>
            distribution reference
          </Link>
          . For this example, we’ll go with Debian 8.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Creating your new Linode</h2>
        <p>
          Now that you’ve selected a region, type, and distribution, you’re ready to launch a
          new Linode! The API calls above were unauthenticated because they return only publicly
          visible information. However, launching a Linode is tied to your account so this
          call must be authenticated.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will need to substitute your authorization token in the command below before
          running it (replace <strong>$TOKEN</strong>). If you don’t yet have an authorization
          token, read through the Testing with curl guide before proceeding.
        </p>
        <p>
          You should also set a root password for the new Linode
          (replace <strong>$root_pass</strong>).
        </p>
        <p>
          As you can see, the region, type, and Linux distribution are all specified in the
          JSON POST data and can be changed as needed to deploy Linodes to different locations
          and with different characteristics. Customize the following curl command and run it
          when you’re ready to deploy:
        </p>
        <Code
          // eslint-disable-next-line max-len
          example={`curl -X POST ${API_ROOT}/${API_VERSION}/linode/instances -d '{"type": "g5-standard-1", "region": "us-east-1a", "distribution": "linode/debian8", "root_pass": "$root_pass", "label": "prod-1"}' \\
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-type: application/json"
`}
          name="bash"
        />
        <p>
          If all was successful, you should get a response object detailing the newly
          created Linode like the following:
        </p>
        <Code
          example={`{
  "id": 123456,
  "transfer_total": 2000,
  "label": "prod-1",
  "status": "provisioning",
  "group": "",
  "updated": "2016-11-10T19:01:12",
  "created": "2016-11-10T19:01:12",
  "hypervisor": "kvm",
  "ipv4": "97.107.143.56",
  "ipv6": "2600:3c03::f03c:91ff:fe0a:18ab/64",
  "region": "us-east-1a",
  "type":  "g5-standard-1",
  "distribution": "linode/debian8",
  "alerts": {
    "cpu":  90,
    "transfer_out": 10,
    "io": 10000,
    "transfer_quota": 80,
    "transfer_in": 10
  },
  "backups": {
    "enabled": false,
    "schedule": {
       "day": null,
       "window": null
    }
  }
}`}
          name="json"
          noclipboard
        />
        <p>
          The above response contains lots of details about the newly created Linode,
          including IP addresses, alerts, region information, and meta-data like the date
          and time it was created. For information on all of the returned fields, please
          see the Linode object reference. Take note of the id field, as you will need it
          for the next step.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Booting a Linode</h2>
        <p>
          Before you can use your new Linode, you will need to boot it. Take the <code>id</code>
          returned by the previous API call and substitute it for <code>$linode_id</code> in the
          following curl command. Also remember to replace <strong>$TOKEN</strong> with your
          authorization token as in the previous API call.
        </p>
        <Code
          example={`curl -X POST ${API_ROOT}/${API_VERSION}/linode/instances/$linode_id/boot \\
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
`}
          name="bash"
        />
        <p>
          You’ll receive an empty response (<code>{'{}'}</code>) - this is the expected behavior.
          If the status code is 200, it worked. You can now watch for the Linode’s state field
          to change from "booting" to "running":
        </p>
        <Code
          example={`curl ${API_ROOT}/${API_VERSION}/linode/instances/$linode_id \\
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
`}
          name="bash"
        />
        <Code
          example={`{
  "linode": {
      "id": 123456,
      "label": "prod-1",
      "status": "running",
      /* and so on */
  }
}`}
          name="json"
          noclipboard
        />
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>SSH into your Linode</h2>
        <p>
          Run the SSH command from the Linode response object and enter the root password
          you set in the create Linode step:
        </p>
        <Code example="ssh root@$public_ip" name="bash" />
        <p>
          Congratulations! You have now successfully launched a Linode through the API.
